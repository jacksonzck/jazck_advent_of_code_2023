Heya! 

These are my advent of code submissions. 

At time of writing, I plan to do it all on a single webpage driven by react. 

This is a ***bad*** way of doing AoC. TOO BAD! You ain't the boss of me m8 >:D

*dabs on the haters*.

Yeah I'll probably fill this out with stuff later.

Have like a pipeline to automatically vomit it out onto github pages or somesuch. 

But I didn't do that yet, so GET GOT.
